How to attach files to SAGE: (note: using attach rather than load will automatically refresh files when they are saved, to avoid reloading each time)

Ex:

 attach("/mnt/c/Users/welio/Documents/Boulder/Research/SAGE/[Folder name]/[Document name].sage")

Ex (attach ALL files in folder) (NOTE: This also attaches all files in my Misc Folder, as these are general utilities):

path = "/mnt/c/Users/welio/Documents/Boulder/Research/SAGE/[Folder name]/"
misc_path = "/mnt/c/Users/welio/Documents/Boulder/Research/SAGE/Misc/"
filenames = os.listdir(path)
misc_filenames = os.listdir(misc_path)
attach(*[path + filenames[i] for i in [0..len(filenames)-1]])
attach(*[misc_path + misc_filenames[i] for i in [0..len(misc_filenames)-1]])

Path to my data folder for reading and writing data:

data_path = "/mnt/c/Users/welio/Documents/Boulder/Research/SAGE/Data"

TO SAVE FIGURES MADE FROM PANDAS DATA:

plt = df.plot([options])
plt.get_figure.savefig(data_path + [path_to_final_location])
