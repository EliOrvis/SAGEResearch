How to attach files to SAGE: (note: using attach rather than load will automatically refresh files when they are saved, to avoid reloading each time)

Ex:

 attach("/mnt/c/Users/welio/Documents/Boulder/Research/SAGE/[Folder name]/[Document name].sage")

Ex (attach ALL files in folder):

path = "/mnt/c/Users/welio/Documents/Boulder/Research/SAGE/[Folder name]/"
filenames = os.listdir(path)
attach(*[path + filenames[i] for i in [0..len(filenames)-1]])

Path to my data folder for reading and writing data:

data_path = "/mnt/c/Users/welio/Documents/Boulder/Research/SAGE/Data"
